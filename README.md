# GameNative-Performance

GameNative-Performance is a high-performance fork of GameNative, optimized specifically for Adreno-powered devices (Snapdragon 8 Gen 1/2/3/Elite). It introduces aggressive clock management, internal file system access, and robust save game portability.

## New Features (Performance Variant)

### 🚀 Hardware Performance Optimization
- **Force Maximum Clocks (Non-Root):** Integrated loop detection via Adreno Tools that re-applies maximum GPU clock requests every 5 seconds to prevent system downclocking.
- **Root Maximum Performance:** For rooted users, an aggressive **500ms loop** that monitors hardware nodes and instantly rewrites CPU/GPU registers if a frequency drop is detected.
- **Aggressive Power Profiles:** Forces Adreno power levels to 0 (Maximum) and disables GPU "napping" to maintain peak FPS in demanding titles.
- **Fuzzy GPU Node Detection:** Automatically identifies and targets device-specific clock nodes (e.g., hitting 1200MHz on Adreno 840).

### 📂 Advanced File Management
- **Embedded File Explorer:** A full-screen internal file manager with Multi-select, Copy, Cut, Paste, and Delete capabilities. Access `/data/data/app.gamenative` without needing root.
- **GNP Documents Provider:** Exposes the app's internal data directory to external file managers (Solid Explorer, ZArchiver, etc.), making it easy to sideload patches or manually manage data.
- **Enhanced Save Portability:** 
    - **Robust Export:** Packages saves into a standardized `drive_c/` structure with proactive user remapping.
    - **Fuzzy Import:** Intelligent "fuzzy" matching for game titles that ignores spaces/special characters, ensuring saves land in the correct folder even if the ZIP name differs.
    - **Cross-User Compatibility:** Automatically remaps legacy `steamuser` paths to `xuser` for seamless migration from other Winlator/GameHub forks.

### 🛠️ Stability & UX Fixes
- **Async Root Checks:** Root verification no longer freezes the UI; it runs on a background thread with a 5-second safety timeout.
- **Cleaned UI:** Refactored Graphics Settings to remove duplicate VKD3D and DX Wrapper entries, providing a cleaner, more intuitive interface.
- **Error Resilience:** Added extensive try-catch wrapping around native performance calls to ensure the app remains stable on all Android versions.
